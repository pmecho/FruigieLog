Overview:
	This is a simple android application that will track fruit and vegetable 
	intake.  The main purpose of this app is to help me learn about Android 
	and Git.  Once finished, it will be published for free to the market.
	
Design:
	So far it's pretty simple.  Single activity and (recently) a content
	provider to interact with the SQLite database.  Will probably need to 
	split up the view/activity to when swipe animation is implemented.
	
Usability:
	Plus and  minus increment and decrement the serving.  You can switch
	between half and full servings. Left and right arrows change the date.
	Swipe left or right to change the date as well.  This is rudimentary, 
	implementation will be polished.
	
Work on this branch will be focused on adding charts
